# Bouncing Ball Game

Welcome to the Bouncing Ball Game, an interactive canvas-based web game where excitement meets challenge. Dive into a world where colorful balls bounce around your screen, and an evil circle hunts them down. It's simple, engaging, and perfect for quick breaks or casual gaming sessions. Hosted on GitHub, this game is easy to access and play from anywhere!

## Features

- **Dynamic Canvas Gameplay**: Experience the seamless movement of balls bouncing off the edges of your screen, each with its unique color and velocity.
  
- **Interactive Evil Circle**: Take control of the Evil Circle with simple keyboard commands. Navigate the canvas to "eat" the bouncing balls by colliding with them.
  
- **Real-Time Ball Count**: Keep track of how many balls are currently bouncing around the screen with a dynamically updated count. Watch as the count decreases each time the Evil Circle captures a ball.
  
- **Engaging Physics**: Enjoy the pseudo-physics that dictate the bouncing balls and their interactions with the boundaries of the canvas and the Evil Circle.
  
- **Colorful Visuals**: Each ball comes in a vibrant, randomly assigned color, making the gameplay not just fun but also a visual treat.

## How to Play

1. **Navigate the Evil Circle**: Use the `W` (up), `A` (left), `S` (down), and `D` (right) keys on your keyboard to move the Evil Circle across the canvas.
  
2. **Capture the Balls**: Collide with the bouncing balls to "eat" them. Each ball captured will disappear from the canvas, decrementing the on-screen ball count.
  
3. **Avoid Getting Overwhelmed**: The game starts with 25 balls. The challenge is to capture them all. Can you clear the screen?
